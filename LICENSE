ZLibWrapper's initial stream implementations are based on zlibnet,
and it was ported from .NET managed C++ zlib wrapper, ManagedZLib:
http://zlibnetwrapper.sourceforge.net

ZLib .NET Wrapper - Version 1.1.1, May 31st, 2005

Copyright (C) 2004,2005 Dave F. Baskin

This project wraps version 1.2.2 of the ZLib source in a Microsoft .NET
mixed-mode DLL wrapper.  This should give native performance to the ZLib
functions while wrapping the compression and decompression functions
in a .NET-friendly Stream object.  Additional BinaryReader- and
BinaryWriter-derived classes are also defined to provide thin wrappers
around the compression Stream object.

There were no changes made to the ZLib source (thus the version number
of ZLib was not changed).

This software is released under the same ZLib license as the ZLib
source itself:
